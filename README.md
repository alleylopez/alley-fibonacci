# Alley Fibonacci

This project is a Flutter application designed to showcase the differences between good and bad practices in HTTP request handling. It also serves as a playground to explore various mathematical concepts, starting with the Fibonacci sequence.

## Features

- **HTTP Practice Demonstration:** The app will have two main sections, one implementing robust, efficient, and user-friendly HTTP requests (good practices) and another showing common pitfalls and anti-patterns (bad practices).
- **Mathematical Explorations:** Starting with a Fibonacci sequence generator, the app will be expanded to include other mathematical functions and algorithms.
- **Interactive UI:** A clean and responsive user interface built with Flutter.
